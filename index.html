				If one day in the future, I make you think about this website again, and make you go:<br>

						Can you believe it? I can't believe it myself either.<br>
						It's been a long time coming, and a lot has changed since then, but something that never<br>
						changed or left my mind, was RootPain.com. And I promised I'd be back for more, and after<br>
						spending an entire year planning and rebuilding the website from the ground up, it's here.<br>
						Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed. The latest, and possibly final iteration of RootPain.com.<br>
						I know it took me a good while, but I believe the effort was worth it.<br>
						There is a lot to talk about, and a lot to go over. So where do I even begin?<br>
						</p>
						</div>
						<div style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;'>
						<p class='text' style='margin-left:10px;'>
						I guess why I even decided to remake the website (again) is a good place to start.<br>
						<br>
						At the end of 2023, I said that I wanted to return to making frequent updates to the website again since<br>
						I really slacked off with it when in comparison to the original website, where I used to update it frequently<br>
						and seemed very enthusiastic to work on it overall (this was also in part due to me being younger and a little<br>
						less jaded, I didn't really had a job back in the day, and the website was far simpler, and easier to work with)<br>
						and I actually had a lot of cool ideas I wanted to bring to the table, with one of my ideas being a "new era"<br>
						for the website, centered around theme of "a big city", which I was going to dub "The City Era"<br>
						However, things already got incredibly messy by the beginning of 2024, and specially during mid 2024.<br>
						<br>
						2023 was a year of huge changes, specially growth for me, with me learning a lot of things<br>
						completely changing the way I go about life and treating others, and pretty much just becoming an entirely new<br>
						person after mid-2023 due to a multitude of experiences that led to me finally "waking up", and finally<br>
						allowing myself to become someone at least decent. I came into terms with a lot of things about my life and myself<br>
						I ended up rekindling a ton of friendships, and allowing myself to make new ones due to these changes, and I consider<br>
						that period the moment I truly became something respectable, the period when "June", that "second chance"<br>
						I've been running after for so long, the person I wanted to become, stopped being a dream, and became a reality.<br>
						<br>
						2024, however, was a year of pure loss and stagnation in a lot of ways.<br>
						The year started horribly, with me having a ton of fights with a multitude of friends<br>
						Then my job started to become a lot for me to handle, with me having days where I wasn't able to sleep at home<br>
						because my job would leave me completely stressed to the point that I couldn't sleep when I got home<br>
						leaving me completely tired and defeated when I arrived at my job, or I'd sleep all day until I had to get up<br>
						and get ready for work, leaving me with little to no time or motivation to do anything else.<br>
						That stress built a lot of things on me, mostly frustration and dissatisfaction, and that dissatisfaction<br>
						ended up seeping into my works, and my life as a whole.<br>
						<br>
						This dissatisfaction and pent up rage over my job ended up making me upset with a lot of things that I normally<br>
						wouldn't be as bothered as I normally would, and at one point, once again, I felt like it was just me against<br>
						the world. And I kept entertaining the idea of just "running away". And at one point, I almost did.<br>
						<br>
						At one point, all of my accounts (with the exception of Newgrounds) were either deactivated, or gone.<br>
						But after one of my friends kept calling my cellphone and chasing me around, I came back. Resentfully so.<br>
						<br>
						But what really destroyed my motivation and made me give up on "the next big thing" for RootPain.com was<br>
						this one friend, the person that I used to consider "my partner" in a lot of ways, left after me and him<br>
						had a falling out over the most retarded reason imaginable, and I don't use that word lightly.<br>
						<br>
						After he left, I felt genuinely lost. Specially because at one point, we used to do everything together<br>
						So all of my works, my website included, had his DNA on every inch of my person and my works. So every time<br>
						I looked into my website, or anywhere for that matter, I saw him, and any motivation to go back and try again<br>
						would fade out in an instant, and once again, I was at step zero.<br>
						<br>
						I tried to come back, and take him away from my website and everywhere, but nothing really hit the same.<br>
						I made the website with the intent of proudly using the things he made for me, and without him, everything<br>
						felt hollow. And I simply couldn't bring myself to delete the things he made for me from my drives and folders<br>
						because despite everything, I still loved him a lot, and in a lot of ways, I still do.<br>
						<br>
						But if I couldn't bring myself to do any of that, I couldn't bring myself to work on RootPain.com again.<br>
						And even though RootPain.com wasn't getting any new updates, it never left my mind, not even for a day.<br>
						But for the time, there was nothing I could do.<br>
						<br>
						Skip to 2025.<br>
						I decided to read my email again, for some reason. And unexpectedly, someone left a guestbook message<br>
						after a good time without me receiving anything new. Of course, I decided to read it, not expecting much<br>
						besides the usual, but what I got was an extremely heartwarming message.<br>
						<br>
						Unfortunately, I cannot access my old email anymore, but I still remember the message very well<br>
						The person sending it, told me how cool they thought my website was, and that they felt bad for not finding<br>
						it sooner when it was still getting frequent updates, and that my website "really made them want more".<br>
						<br>
						While reading that, I felt this weird sense of comfort and accomplishment, because at the end of the day<br>
						one of the main objectives when first making RootPain.com. To make a website that made someone feel the exact<br>
						same thing I felt when I was younger and use to scroll through "The Mystical Forest Zone" on a daily basis.<br>
						I wanted to show someone something that they never knew they needed until they saw it<br>
						I wanted to make someone go "I want to make something like this one day" just like TMFZ did for me back then.<br>
						So seeing that I pretty much accomplished that, and they had hopes that I would make my return one day<br>
						resparked something in me again, even if very briefly, and very faintly. So I decided to start fiddling with<br>
						HTML and CSS again, and I started by remaking the home page of the website.<br>
						<br>
						Although I did improve upon it a lot, I abandoned it after a while due to me once again having difficulties<br>
						when it came to achieving certain results, so I decided to leave this idea for later.<br>
						But even after that, I started to tinker with new ideas, how to expand my website, what to refine<br>
						what to keep, what to throw away, and what else could I do for it?<br>
						<br>
						There were days on my job, where I'd sit around in the cafeteria, and I'd spent my whole break looking for<br>
						inspirations and ideas for this new version of RootPain.com. There were days where I'd write and rewrite<br>
						entire articles in preparation for the new website, and sometimes I'd even daydream of making a really cool<br>
						trailer for when it launched, if that day ever came.<br>
						<br>
						And slowly, but surely, the idea of my website was once again taking control of me once again.<br>
						<br>
						But what really drove me to revisit my website and my art hobby as a whole (besides my friends making cool shit<br>
						that inspired me), was finding out this two part animation called "Charlotte's Apprenticheship." from this guy on<br>
						Newgrounds called "ICantSeeHelp".<br>
						<br>
						It was a very weird and experimental animation about this girl trying to achieve perfection and suffering because of it<br>
						and for some reason, it really resonated with me. Mostly because I was in a similar shell during that time, where I felt<br>
						pretty isolated and disconnected from everyone and everything, and despite how much I wanted to go back to drawing and<br>
						enjoying making things, I could never really scratch that itch, no matter how much I forced myself. There were<br>
						improvements, but I still felt like something was wrong, and the way those animations played out, with this weird mixture<br>
						of shitpost and sincerity made me feel connected to something art related like I haven't felt in YEARS probably (aside<br>
						from Kingdom Hearts, which was something I really got invested into during that time), and the character of Charlotte Gray<br>
						in general is beautiful in genuinely every sense of the word.<br>
						<br>
						Me describing the whole thing in here would make a huge disservice to it, so I'll instead tell you to go watch it yourself<br>
						by clicking this hyperlink. But all you need to know is, it definitely sparked something in me again.<br>
						<br>
						It's probably the first time I've "fangirled" over anything in years, really.<br>
						<br>
						And eventually I started making fanart of Charlotte Gray, and it was one of the first times after so long where I genuinely<br>
						took my time inserting little details and taking so much care when making something, and seeing that people noticed these<br>
						little details, and saw how much it meant to me, motivated me to "push it a little further", even if for just a little longer.<br>
						One of them even got frontpaged, and it was also the main feature for the Takeover Tuesday. This blew my mind.<br>
						<br>
						ICantSeeHelp even made some Big Whiskey fanart at one point (which honestly made me go completely red<br>
						and I had a shit eating grin for the rest of the week pretty much.), and all of these things happening in succession<br>
						made me want to do more to push myself further, and RootPain.com once again became a huge consideration in my head.<br>
						<br>
						And then I started fiddling with it again for a little bit, and I was like "this could work".<br>
						<br>
						But what really drove me to fully resume work on it was ICantSeeHelp's website.<br>
						<br>
						I saw a post that he updated his website again, and I decided to take a quick look into it. Very cool and stylish website<br>
						Pretty edgy too, which is pretty much everything I like.<br>
						<br>
						But when I scrolled at the bottom, I saw it there.<br>
						<br>
						When I first saw it, I barely woke up, it was like 6AM in the morning, but when I saw the RootPain.com banner/button at the<br>
						bottom, I genuinely jumped out of my bed, fully awake.<br>
						<br>
						Everything built up to this moment.<br>
						That guestbook message, my friends rebuilding their website, my vacation coming up, my website being featured on his<br>
						and when I heard that the reason he even went back to his website was because he saw me fiddling with mine<br>
						I immediately locked in, and made the decision to finally finish Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed.<br>
						<br>
						So after a year, a ton of headbreaking, and a ton of heartbreaks too, it's finally here.<br>
