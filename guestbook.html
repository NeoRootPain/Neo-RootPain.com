						Hey there. I see you found my website.<br>
						Or maybe I found you. Doesn't that sound deep?<br>
						Anyways, I'm glad we crossed paths either way.<br>
						Coincidence? There is no such thing as a coincidence.<br>
						</p>
						</div>
						<div style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;'>
						<p class='textbottom' style='margin-top:5px;'>
						Everything happens with a purpose. Even if takes a while for you to find<br>
						out what that purpose is, or was.<br>
						<br>
						But me being pretentious by trying to sound deep aside.<br>
						I want to say that finally finishing this website means everything to me.<br>
						<br>
						This website, in a lot of ways, is a pure reflection of<br>
						everything I am, and at one point, was.<br>
						<br>
						I started very rough, being incredibly bitter and angry at all times<br>
						thinking that I was above everything and everyone else, despite barely<br>
						being above mediocre.<br>
						<br>
						But I like to believe I've grown into something better.<br>
						I'm now refined, I lead life and myself with a better disposition<br>
						and I've evolved myself and my works into something that I believe<br>
						everyone, myself included, can be proud of.<br>
						<br>
						I'm not a perfect guy, I don't want to pretend to, or be one<br>
						I'm still very angry at times, I still struggle to say and do<br>
						the right things, I'm always coming back to try again.<br>
						<br>
						It's like I always say; <b>"Trying is everything anyone could ask for."</b><br>
						<br>
						I made Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed as a celebration of everything<br>
						The good, the bad, the past, the present, the future<br>
						The new, the old, the JuneSSai.net, and the RootPain.com<br>
						The Victor, The RootPain, and the June.<br>
						<br>
						It's been a rocky road, but if life didn't go the way it went<br>
						none of this would've been possible, we wouldn't be here today.<br>
						<br>
						Every experience is valid, and every experience leads up to something<br>
						better. Something bigger, and for me, it led me back to this website.<br>
						Something that was only a childhood dream, that eventually<br>
						became a reality.<br>
						<br>
						I hope that my passion shows through every page you scroll by<br>
						and I hope that one day in the future, you'll think about this website<br>
						again and go "Wow, that website was cool.", and maybe even go<br>
						"I want to make something like that one day."<br>
						And if I got you to think like that, then all the effort was worth it.<br>
						<br>
						Maybe you're already reading this in the future.<br>
						Maybe you've already made your own, and better website.<br>
						Maybe you've made it because of me!<br>
						If that's the case, I'm proud of you. And I'm happy that something<br>
						I made could've had such an impact on anyone out there.<br>
						<br>
						Either you're new, or you've been around for quite a while<br>
						Thanks for sticking around, and thanks for the support<br>
						specially if you sticked with me even at my lowest of lows.<br>
						<br>
						And in case we met under bad circumstances (when I used to be a<br>
						complete piece of shit back in the day), I'm sorry. Genuinely.<br>
						<br>
						Either way, keep on trying.<br>
						Because trying is everything is anyone could ask for.<br>
						<br>
						It's not easy, and it will never be easy<br>
						But it's just like I always say.<br>
						<br>
						<b>"Nothing worthwhile is ever easy."</b><br>
						<br>
						I've been finishing my posts with "The Struggle Continues"<br>
						for about a year and a half now.<br>
						<br>
						So I think it's only fitting I end this guestbook message with...<br>
						<span style='color:orange'><i><b>The Struggle Is Over.</b></i></span><br>
						<br>
						'Till we meet again!<br>
						Don't forget to sign the Guestbook!<br>
						<br>
						Seriously. Sign it. This took me a while to make.<br>
						It's the coolest section in the entire website and I'd hate to see it unused.<br>
						Plus, I like getting messages.</p>
