				<p>wow look at you. you're so fucking sneaky aren't you?<br>

				"wow june you're so fucking lazy you didn't even bother to delete the rest of the stuff and you just<br>
				copy and pasted another page with slight changes you stupid fuck"<br>
				<br>
				well maybe you shouldn't complain to a magician that the magic lost it's charm once you<br>
				find out how it's done you dumb fuck you piece of shit. maybe you're not supposed to see<br>
				ANY of this and you're just trying to be cute and funny. but guess what.<br>
				even a 90yo senile with barely to no tech skills could use inspect element and find about this shit.<br>
				even your ipad cousin would be able to do it. still think it's impressive? maybe you should shut the FUCK up.<br>
				<br>
				why you gotta be so FUCKING judgmental and annoying can't you just FUCKING enjoy life something without instantly<br>
				criticizing it for once? your cynicism isn't endearing it's just annoying. ok?<br>
				<br>
				this was supposed to be a cute thing i made for someone, but now you just made it awkward. thanks asshole.<br>
