						Can you believe it? I can't believe it myself either.<br>
						It's been a long time coming, and a lot has changed since then, but something that never<br>
						changed or left my mind, was RootPain.com. And I promised I'd be back for more, and after<br>
						spending an entire year planning and rebuilding the website from the ground up, it's here.<br>
						Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed. The latest, and possibly final iteration of RootPain.com.<br>

						<div style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;'>
						<p class='textbottom' style='margin-top:5px;'>
						I know it took me a good while, but I believe the effort was worth it.<br>
						There is a lot to talk about, and a lot to go over. So where do I even begin?<br>
						I guess why I even decided to remake the website (again) is a good place to start.</p>

						<p class='textbottom'>At the end of 2023, I said that I wanted to return to making frequent updates to the website again since<br>
						I really slacked off with it when in comparison to the original website, where I used to update it frequently<br>
						and seemed very enthusiastic to work on it overall (this was also in part due to me being younger and a little<br>
						less jaded, I didn't really had a job back in the day, and the website was far simpler, and easier to work with)<br>
						and I actually had a lot of cool ideas I wanted to bring to the table, with one of my ideas being a "new era"<br>
						for the website, centered around theme of "a big city", which I was going to dub "The City Era"<br>
						However, things already got incredibly messy by the beginning of 2024, and specially during mid 2024.<br>
						<br>
						2023 was a year of huge changes, specially growth for me, with me learning a lot of things<br>
						completely changing the way I go about life and treating others, and pretty much just becoming an entirely new<br>
						person after mid-2023 due to a multitude of experiences that led to me finally "waking up", and finally<br>
						allowing myself to become someone at least decent. I came into terms with a lot of things about my life and myself<br>
						I ended up rekindling a ton of friendships, and allowing myself to make new ones due to these changes, and I consider<br>
						that period the moment I truly became something respectable, the period when "June", that "second chance"<br>
						I've been running after for so long, the person I wanted to become, stopped being a dream, and became a reality.<br>
						<br>
						2024, however, was a year of pure loss and stagnation in a lot of ways.<br>
						The year started horribly, with me having a ton of fights with a multitude of friends<br>
						Then my job started to become a lot for me to handle, with me having days where I wasn't able to sleep at home<br>
						because my job would leave me completely stressed to the point that I couldn't sleep when I got home<br>
						leaving me completely tired and defeated when I arrived at my job, or I'd sleep all day until I had to get up<br>
						and get ready for work, leaving me with little to no time or motivation to do anything else.<br>
						That stress built a lot of things on me, mostly frustration and dissatisfaction, and that dissatisfaction<br>
						ended up seeping into my works, and my life as a whole.<br>
						<br>
						This dissatisfaction and pent up rage over my job ended up making me upset with a lot of things that I normally<br>
						wouldn't be as bothered as I normally would, and at one point, once again, I felt like it was just me against<br>
						the world. And I kept entertaining the idea of just "running away". And at one point, I almost did.<br>
						<br>
						At one point, all of my accounts (with the exception of Newgrounds) were either deactivated, or gone.<br>
						But after one of my friends kept calling my cellphone and chasing me around, I came back. Resentfully so.<br>
						<br>
						But what really destroyed my motivation and made me give up on "the next big thing" for RootPain.com was<br>
						this one friend, the person that I used to consider "my partner" in a lot of ways, left, after me and him<br>
						had a falling out over the most retarded reason imaginable.<br>
						<br>
						"Oh June, that sounds a bit too harsh, don't you think?" No. I don't. In fact, I think I'm being way too<br>
						generous when I say it's just retarded, it's beyond that, to the point I'm still thinking of a heavier<br>
						word to describe how ridiculous and idiotic that whole discussion was.<br>
						<br>
						Anyways. After he left, I felt genuinely lost. Specially because at one point, we used to do everything together<br>
						So all of my works, my website included, had his DNA on every inch of my person and my works. So every time<br>
						I looked into my website, or anywhere for that matter, I saw him, and any motivation to go back and try again<br>
						would fade out in an instant, and once again, I was at step zero.<br>
						<br>
						I tried to come back, and take him away from my website and everywhere, but nothing really hit the same.<br>
						I made the website with the intent of proudly using the things he made for me, and without him, everything<br>
						felt hollow. And I simply couldn't bring myself to delete the things he made for me from my drives and folders<br>
						because despite everything, I still loved him a lot, and in a lot of ways, I still do.<br>
						<br>
						But if I couldn't bring myself to do any of that, I couldn't bring myself to work on RootPain.com again.<br>
						And even though RootPain.com wasn't getting any new updates, it never left my mind, not even for a day.<br>
						But for the time, there was nothing I could do.<br>
						<br>
						At one point, I didn't even feel sad or angry, I just felt tired and empty.<br>
						And for a while, that was it.<br>
						<br>
						Skip to 2025.<br>
						I decided to read my email again, for some reason. And unexpectedly, someone left a guestbook message<br>
						after a good time without me receiving anything new. Of course, I decided to read it, not expecting much<br>
						besides the usual, but what I got was an extremely heartwarming message.<br>
						<br>
						Unfortunately, I cannot access my old email anymore, but I still remember the message very well<br>
						The person sending it, told me how cool they thought my website was, and that they felt bad for not finding<br>
						it sooner when it was still getting frequent updates, and that my website "really made them want more".<br>
						<br>
						While reading that, I felt this weird sense of comfort and accomplishment, because at the end of the day<br>
						one of the main objectives when first making RootPain.com. To make a website that made someone feel the exact<br>
						same thing I felt when I was younger and use to scroll through "The Mystical Forest Zone" on a daily basis.<br>
						I wanted to show someone something that they never knew they needed until they saw it<br>
						I wanted to make someone go "I want to make something like this one day" just like TMFZ did for me back then.<br>
						So seeing that I pretty much accomplished that, and they had hopes that I would make my return one day<br>
						resparked something in me again, even if very briefly, and very faintly. So I decided to start fiddling with<br>
						HTML and CSS again, and I started by remaking the home page of the website.</p>
							<div class='imagecontainer' style='width:95%;'>
							<a href='../images/postimages/firstprototype.png' target='_blank'>
							<img src='../images/postimages/firstprototype.png' class='postimage'></a>
							</div>
						<p class='textbottom'>
						Although I did improve upon it a lot, I abandoned it after a while due to me once again having difficulties<br>
						when it came to achieving certain results, so I decided to leave this idea for later.<br>
						But even after that, I started to tinker with new ideas, how to expand my website, what to refine<br>
						what to keep, what to throw away, and what else could I do for it?<br>
						<br>
						There were days on my job, where I'd sit around in the cafeteria, and I'd spent my whole break looking for<br>
						inspirations and ideas for this new version of RootPain.com. There were days where I'd write and rewrite<br>
						entire articles in preparation for the new website, and sometimes I'd even daydream of making a really cool<br>
						trailer for when it launched, if that day ever came.<br>
						<br>
						And slowly, but surely, the idea of my website was once again taking control of me once again.<br>
						<br>
						But what really drove me to revisit my website and my art hobby as a whole (besides my friends making cool shit<br>
						that inspired me), was finding out this two part animation called "Charlotte's Apprenticheship." from this guy on<br>
						Newgrounds called "ICantSeeHelp".</p>

							<a href='../images/postimages/whenifirstmether.png' target='_blank'>
							<img src='../images/postimages/whenifirstmether.png' class='postimage'></a>
							</div>
						<br>
						<p class='textbottom'>It was a very weird and experimental animation about this girl trying to achieve perfection and suffering because of it<br>
						and for some reason, it really resonated with me. Mostly because I was in a similar shell during that time, where I felt<br>
						pretty isolated and disconnected from everyone and everything, and despite how much I wanted to go back to drawing and<br>
						enjoying making things, I could never really scratch that itch, no matter how much I forced myself. There were<br>
						improvements, but I still felt like something was wrong, and the way those animations played out, with this weird mixture<br>
						of shitpost and sincerity made me feel connected to something art related like I haven't felt in YEARS probably (aside<br>
						from Kingdom Hearts, which was something I really got invested into during that time), and the character of Charlotte Gray<br>
						in general is beautiful in genuinely every sense of the word.<br>
						<br>
						Me describing the whole thing in here would make a huge disservice to it, so I'll instead tell you to go watch it yourself<br>
						by <a href='https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/986726' target='_blank'>clicking this hyperlink</a>. But all you need to know is, it definitely sparked something in me again.<br>
						<br>
						It's probably the first time I've "fangirled" over anything in years, really.<br>
						And even after retyping this countless times, I still feel like a bit of a loser for losing my shit so much over<br>
						these animations, and specially over this fucking character, but I can't help it.<br>
						<br>
						I love a woman, and she's not even real.<br>
						<br>
						Anyways, I eventually I started making fanart of Charlotte Gray, and it was one of the first times after<br>
						so long where I genuinely took my time inserting little details and taking so much care when making something<br>
						and seeing that people noticed these little details, and saw how much it meant to me, motivated me to<br>
						"push it a little further", even if for just a little longer. One of them even got frontpaged, and it was also<br>
						the main feature for the Takeover Tuesday. This blew my mind.<br>
						<br>
						ICantSeeHelp even started following me at one point.<br>
						You know how excited I was? I did that whole a little cheer and jump when I found about it.<br>
						I was at my job, during my shift.<br>
						<br>
						Again, the first time I've fangirled over anything.<br>
						<br>
						ICantSeeHelp even made some Big Whiskey fanart at one point (which honestly made me go completely red<br>
						and I had a shit eating grin for the rest of the week pretty much.), and all of these things happening in succession<br>
						made me want to do more to push myself further, and RootPain.com once again became a huge consideration in my head.<br>
						<br>
						And then I started fiddling with it again for a little bit, and I was like "this could work".<br>
						<br>
						But what really drove me to fully resume work on it was ICantSeeHelp's website.<br>
						<br>
						I saw a post that he updated his website again, and I decided to take a quick look into it. Very cool and stylish website<br>
						Pretty edgy too, which is pretty much everything I like.<br>
						<br>
						But when I scrolled at the bottom, I saw it there.</p>

						<p class='textbottom'>
						When I first saw it, I barely woke up, it was like six in the morning, but when I saw the RootPain.com banner/button at the<br>
						bottom, I genuinely jumped out of my bed, fully awake. I was so happy you couldn't believe it.<br>
						<br>
						At this point, I never really thought a majority of people wouldn't even bother to scroll through RootPain.com anymore<br>
						considering I left it abandoned for an entire year, but yet, there it was, in all it's glory, being displayed on the<br>
						website of the person that made what's probably my favorite art thing in years.<br>
						<br>
						In a weird way, everything built up to this moment.<br>
						That guestbook message, my friends rebuilding their website, my vacation coming up, my website being featured on his<br>
						and when I heard that the reason he even went back to his website was because he saw me fiddling with mine<br>
						I immediately locked in, and made the decision to finally finish Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed.<br>
						<br>
						And so, work once again, resumed, and this time, I planned to take it to the very end.<br>
						<br>
						My biggest problem when trying to rework my website again, is that I had no real plan, nor any good idea of what<br>
						I was trying to do or wanted, and in a lot of ways, it felt like I just wanted to redesign it for the sake of<br>
						redesigning it. So my first plan was to actually lay out a plan, and try to figure out what I should be aiming for.<br>
						<br>
						The menus were the first thing I started fiddling with. I remember before abandoning the old website, I had a ton of<br>
						fun figuring out CSS effects, and how making the buttons go up and glow was the coolest thing to me, and I wanted to<br>
						try and make something that looks even cooler for this iteration. So I quickly came up with a plan of making so not<br>
						only whenever you hover over the buttons they give you a cool color change effect, but they also give you a quick<br>
						introduction of what that section is likely to include on a little image slide.<br>
						<br>
						Although it looks very simple, it does help to boost the "cool factor" of the website.<br>
						Although implementing it was an actual nightmare, and it's still a bit finnicky to use in a lot of ways.<br>
						<br>
						The next thing after the buttons, was the menus themselves. The old ones looked pretty rough and amateur<br>
						I had a good idea going for them, to make everything look futuristic, but the execution was subpar at best, so when<br>
						revisiting them, I wanted to finally execute this idea properly, by making the menus look actually futuristic by giving<br>
						them this metallic/cyberpunk vibe to them (I think that's the word), and although the sprite work is simple, it really<br>
						does help to make things look a bit more organic.<br>
						<br>
						And the last thing, which is something I could never figure out how to implement in the old website, and was one of the<br>
						main contributing factors to my frustration with HTML, was the menu sounds.<br>
						<br>
						I always wanted my menus to have sound whenever you hover over the buttons, but I could never get them to actually work<br>
						on the old RootPain.com. So after a lot of heartbreak and headbreaking, I finally got them to work.<br>
						And honestly, the difference is night and day. It's something very simple, but it does make so that the menus give<br>
						more of a "videogame menu" vibe to them, which considering this website is supposed to be like one of those old<br>
						Sonic/Game websites from back in the early 2000's, it helps to sell that type of vibe a ton.<br>
						<br>
						After the menus were done, the next thing to figure out was the website backgrounds, how they looked, and most importantly<br>
						how to get animated backgrounds working, which is what made me give up completely on RootPain.com for a while.<br>
						<br>
						One of the last planned updates for the old website was to make so the backgrounds were actually animated, and I even<br>
						managed to record a perfect loop for a good majority of the backgrounds.<br>
						<br>
						However, once again, nothing was seemingly working.<br>
						<br>
						I tried to rebuild the header from scratch, change the Javascript behavior, but something just wasn't doing it<br>
						and after being stuck in it for a while, I gave up on trying to implement it, and eventually, the website itself.<br>
						<br>
						For this version, I wanted to come back, and finally implement so I could close this chapter for good.<br>
						Turns out, after remaking the whole website structure from the groundup, working on it became far easier, and I managed<br>
						to implement a working animated/webm background very easily. Same goes for the Header background.<br>
						<br>
						After I re-recorded everything in better quality and changed it to MP4s for better quality (while still making sure<br>
						the file size wasn't too big), I pretty much finished the visual side very quickly, with the only thing remaining<br>
						to be changed was the logo and the characters being displayed on the header.<br>
						<br>
						At first, I was going to go with random characters, like Sora or Serious Sam because I wanted to avoid using other people's<br>
						works on my website to avoid a similar situation to the previous iteration, and I didn't had enough (or good enough) works<br>
						of my own to use it aswell. So at one point, I was considering having no characters on the header at all.<br>
						<br>
						But that would never work. After implementing the characters on the header page, not having them just makes the whole<br>
						website feel so empty by comparison, so I had to think of something.<br>
						<br>
						Fortunately, ICantSeeHelp made this amazing fanart of Big Whiskey out of the blue one day, and despite me wanting to<br>
						establish the "No guest artists on the main pages" rules, I was going to break this rule for him. Specially because<br>
						he's responsible for Charlotte's Apprenticheship, and having his works featured on my website would be a huge honor.<br>
						So I asked for permission, and once granted, there he was.<br>
						<br>
						With that out of the way, the logo remade, and the backgrounds implemented, the next thing I had to do was to finish<br>
						the remaining sections, starting with the Blog Section.<br>
						<br>
						And once again, I started to slack off again.<br>
						<br>
						I didn't know how what approach I'd like to have with the new text boxes, how the category selection would look<br>
						or how I'd tackle anything past this point. So I started slacking a little bit again, pretty much just fiddling<br>
						with visuals and seeing if I could fix anything else in the meantime<br>
						<br>
						But eventually, I started talking to ICantSeeHelp, and the conversation eventually devolved into my old websites<br>
						and it would lead into me revisiting my old website, JuneSSai.net, the very first website I made, once again.<br>
						<br>
						And despite how much I avoided looking at old things, going back through my first website again lit a fire inside me<br>
						that I haven't felt burning as brightly in a long time.<br>
						<br>
						The website was very basic, and very poorly made. Everything was broken, a lot of the things I used to write were<br>
						incredibly stupid, and a lot of them were just wrong.<br>
						<br>
						But none of that mattered, because I was having fun.<br>
						While reading through my old posts, I saw the younger me, just having fun, writing everything he felt down, being<br>
						genuine not only with the world, but himself. He believed that website was the coolest thing ever, and with every<br>
						page he made, he believed more and more.<br>
						<br>
						I started going through old Guestbook Messages, seeing how much my design evolved, seeing how much I grew<br>
						but what really made my heart ache for a moment, was reading through one of my older posts<br>
						"The Philosophy Of JuneSSai.net".<br>
						<br>
						It was just me reminiscing about why I made JuneSSai.net to begin with, why I found working with these things<br>
						so cool and interesting, and what my philosophy around that time was. And despite me remembering how depressed<br>
						I used to be (and how awful everything used to be), something I wrote back in the day really stuck with me.<br>

						Passion for the friends and people I've met along the way that impacted<br>

						<br>
						And reading this just made me feel something incredibly powerful, almost like it was me talking to myself in a way.<br>
						<br>
						I remember how depressed I was back then, how I was in a infinitely worse situation, and how everything just sucked<br>
						in general. I genuinely had nothing going for me besides my friends.<br>
						<br>
						And yet, I kept trying.<br>
						I kept saying "No more", and then immediately go back on my word, and give it "one last shot".<br>
						I kept saying that "Everything was pointless", yet I kept giving all the things I did meaning.<br>
						I would keep throwing the towel, but not once that towel stayed on the ground for too long.<br>
						Despite having nothing, I kept trying, and I kept believing. I had a genuine passion holding me together.<br>
						<br>
						At one point, that website, and everyone that visited it, meant everything to me<br>
						And despite everything, I was the happiest I could've ever been, and I firmly believed that.<br>
						<br>
						I remember getting excited over new ideas, and actually figuring out the way to implement them<br>
						I remember being happy with every guestbook message I would get<br>
						I remember feeling incredibly happy when people kept telling me how my website was the coolest thing<br>
						they've ever seen and that they couldn't wait to see more.<br>
						<br>
						And I think somewhere along the way, I allowed that passion and excitement fade away.<br>
						<br>
						Going through that website again, I knew what I wanted to make for this version of RootPain.com<br>
						<br>
						I wanted it to embrace both JuneSSai.net, and RootPain.com.<br>
						I wanted it to embrace both the past, and the future.<br>
						I wanted it to embrace both the good, and the bad.<br>
						I wanted passion to show at every corner of this website at any chance I'd get.<br>
						I wanted it to be <span style='color:orange;'><b><i>The Sum Of Everything</i></b></span>.<br>
						<br>
						Not to try and outdo myself at every corner, but to try and refine what's already there<br>
						and every so often, fix or change things that need to be changed.<br>
						<br>
						A wanted a website that I made with pure love and passion, something that me and others could go through, and just<br>
						have a huge dumb smile in their faces while scrolling through it.<br>
						<br>
						I wanted something that would make people go "I want even more."<br>
						And something that would make me tell myself "I want to do more."<br>
						<br>
						So that would be my plan, and my philosophy, for Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed; Passion.<br>
						<br>

						At one point I just told myself and everyone "that's it.", and I expected everyone, including myself to just be done with it.<br>
						And all that I would do was to keep the website archived so anyone interested in revisiting it's history would be free to do so.<br>
						<br>
						But just like me once I enter your life, RootPain.com never left me, not even for a day.<br>
						And in a ton of ways, nothing of this would be possible without <b>YOU</b>.<br>
						<br>
						I have a lot to thank for.<br>
						The people that stayed, the ones that are now gone.<br>
						The people that showed me kindness and patience, the ones that showed me that I'm never truly alone.<br>
						The people that showed me how to be awful, so I could have a good reference of everything I want to avoid becoming.<br>
						The ones that are here for the ride, and the ones that were just an experience<br>
						The ones that endured and tolerated June S. Sai, so we could get to June Santos.<br>
						The ones that were just there for the experience, and the ones that stayed for the ride.<br>
						<br>
						Either you're new, or you've been keeping up with me and my works ever since I started to bloom...</p>
