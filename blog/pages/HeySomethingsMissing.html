						So. Some of you might be older fans, or even old partners of RootPain.com, and you likely noticed that<br>
						a few sections, and even a few Partners on the Partners Menu are missing! And you are probably<br>
						asking yourself; "What happened? What's happening? Is this permanent? Are they coming back?"<br>
						or you might even be asking "Why am I not there anymore?". Well, I'll make this one a bit<br>
						SIMPLEr and CLEANer than the first blog post, so bear with me for a second, will ya?<br>
						Let's start with a few things that are DEFINITELY making a comeback; the Downloads and Links section.<br>
						The reason why I didn't include them in the initial version of Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed is because I'm still trying<br>
						to refine and redesign these sections, and as of now, I don't have a lot to include in them, or even to make them pop<br>
						in comparison to a lot of the other sections. So instead of delaying the website launch for another month or so<br>
						I'll just do what I did with the initial version of the original RootPain.com and release the website with a few sections<br>
						either unfinished or outright missing. However, I'll just not include them as of now.<br>
						<br>
						But don't you worry. They are coming back for sure, and I have some cool ideas for the Links section, like adding stamps<br>
						and adding more websites for you to discover and to visit while you wait for me to update my own! In general, I want to<br>
						bring new stuff that wasn't in neither of the previous websites, and I think everyone will end up liking what<br>
						I have in store for the near future. I want to try and push the interactivity between contributors and visitors as far<br>
						as I can with this new iteration of the website, so people will always have something fun to look forward, and to even<br>
						outright participate in!<br>
						<br>
						With all that being said, since we're talking about Links and Partners, we might aswell talk about the biggest<br>
						elephant in the room. A lot of the old partners and fanarts, including ones that were included as far as JuneSSai.net<br>
						was still a thing, are now gone. To make a story short; a lot has changed. I don't talk to a lot of these people any longer.<br>
						and some of them don't even have their websites up anymore, or are still reworking them.<br>
						<br>
						A lot has changed since then, myself included, and I'm not sure if these people are still in good terms with me or if<br>
						they'd rather wash their hands and write everything off like nothing ever happened, so I'm giving everyone and easy way<br>
						out and just including the people that I know for a fact would like to be in here.<br>
						<br>
						It's not all bad, some of the new contributors and partners are genuinely some of the greatest people I've met (Tom)<br>
						in recent memory, so I'd say nothing much has changed, specially since you can always just visit the older versions<br>
						of the previous websites through Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed anyways. How? You'll have to find out.<br>
						<br>
						Some fanarts and a few familiar faces are definitely coming back, but besides that, don't hold your breath.<br>
						<br>
						However, if you want to partner up with me, or even if you were a previous contributor that still wishes to be included<br>
						in this new version of my website, please, email me at NeoRootPain@gmail.com, or reach me directly via my socials like<br>
						Newgrounds, Bluesky, or any other place you can find me on.<br>
						<br>
						With that being said, I'm very happy with the way everything turned out.<br>
						There's more to come, and I hope to see you there with me along the way.<br>
						<br>
						Peace out, suckers; it's been real. Godspeed.<br>
