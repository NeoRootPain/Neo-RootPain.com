						Well, well, well... would you look at that. The return of the fanart section, at last!</br>
						And would you look at that, we already started off incredibly well, with our first gardener<br>
						being <b>ICantSeeHelp</b>. If you've read any of the posts, or just looked at my website properly in general<br>
						You'd know how much of a big deal this guy and his art is for me at the moment. In fact, if it wasn't for<br>
						him, I probably would've never finished Neo-RootPain.com: Godspeed to begin with.</p>
						</div>
						<div style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;'>
						<p class='textbottom' style='margin-top:5px;'>
						In a lot of ways, I owe him a lot. And it all pretty much started with his stupid fucking character that took control of me<br>
						and my life like a demon in my brain (a demon that I love with all my heart and I wouldn't want them gone for anything)<br>
						and eventually, this image.<br>
						<br>
						I genuinely wasn't expecting him making fanart for me, like, at all.<br>
						When I first saw this, I was actually at my job, during my shift, and I was just scrolling through my phone since<br>
						that shift was so easy I didn't have to worry about much, so I decided to check Bluesky.<br>
						<br>
						And then I saw he marked me on a post, and once I clicked it. I saw it.<br>
						Happy would be an understatement. I was over the moon. Wide smile, shit eating grin, showing teeth.<br>
						Giggling like a little bitch. Any idiotic term you could think of.<br>
						<br>
						I was so excited, I unironically did the whole run and jump in the air before the frame freezes.<br>
						Of course, you can't freeze frame irl, so I just jumped real high like a fucking moron.<br>
						<br>
						My coworkers were there, and they looked at me wondering if I won at the lottery or something.<br>
						You fools, I won something better.<br>
						<br>
						Anyways, I was genuinely over the moon over this drawing, and I pretty much have been using it for my computer<br>
						and cellphone backgrounds, for my profile pictures, and plastered through the whole website pretty much.<br>
						<br>
						But before I included them here, I had this rule I set for myself that I "would not use other people's art"<br>
						through my website to avoid the same situation that led to the downfall of the original RootPain.com<br>
						<br>
						But I couldn't help myself.<br>
						So after building enough courage, I asked ICantSeeHelp directly if I could his art on my website.<br>
						He said yes, and eventually that would lead to me and him to start talking, which is honestly the best thing<br>
						that happened to me in a good while, and easily the highlight of my year.</p>
