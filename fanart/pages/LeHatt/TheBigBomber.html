						Damn. What a callback. If you know me, or have heard or seen anything from or about me, you're probably<br>
						familiar with this drawing my friend Hatty made for me a while ago. And that's because I've been using this<br>
						fanart pretty much everywhere ever since Hatty made it for me, and to this day, it's still one of my<br>
						all time favorite fanarts, or something someone did for me in general.<br>
						It's super simple, but I think it encapsulates Big Whiskey's vibe and perfectly. Colorful, yet very tired.<br>
						One thing people always seem to get wrong about this image, though, is that everyone thinks he's holding a phone on his ear<br>
						when in reality, he's holding a remote control to detonate a bomb jacket he's wearing beneath his regular jacket.<br>
						But to be fair, I can't really blame anyone, considering not only you can't see the bomb jacket, but it does look like<br>
						he's just holding a regular ass phone. Still, this shit is pretty tuff if I say so myself!<br>
						<br>
						There's also a lesser known version, which ironically enough, was the first one Hatty made!<br>
						The first/initial variation, everything except for the background and outline was yellow. And honestly<br>
						I still really like this version! In general, I really like the idea of making Big Whiskey's whole body and hair yellow.<br>
						This might become an idea I might revisit somewhat later in the future. Maybe. Don't count on it.<br>
						<br>
						Anyways, you should all go give Hatty's stuff your time. Not only he's a great guy, but he's a killer artist too!<br>
						<br>
						Anyways, I'm darting off to pursue my edu<b>Quake</b>tional prowess.<br>
						<br>
						Godspeed.<br>
